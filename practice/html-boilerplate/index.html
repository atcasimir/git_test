    <h1>Welcome to the beginning of a new era... Your new life starts today.</h1>
    <p>Currently listening to "somber home" by Perry Maysun & Zionkat.</p>

    <p>Ryder recently introduced me to Perry Maysun via his duo group, DEAD FI$H, with Ahk Sair. Hella good group.
        They really remind me of the kind of music I used to listen to back during the sophomore/junior years of high
        school.
        That very alternative rap vibe with grungy drums and highly dense lyrics.</p>

    <p>At this point I'm honestly just writing to <strong>write something</strong> now and try out the tags I see.</p>

    <p>When using text modifiers like "<strong>strong</strong>" and "<em>em</em>" they actually change the importance of
        that text, meaning things like E-readers will actually change the voice they use when reading out those words.
