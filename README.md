# git_test

Hello Odin!

This Repository will be my homebase for all of the code that is written on my journey through The Odin Project!

I am hoping that by using the git_test repsitory, it'll help strengthen my Git skills well enough that they'll be nice and sharp by the time the course is completed. Plus it'll be a nostalgia trip when I look back to this, hopefully buried in all the repos I make.

I've got very big dreams and immense goals, and I'm glad to start now. I'll use this repo as a source of inspiration during this first era of my journey.
